# Full Stack Open, part 3

This repo contains exercises for [week 3](https://fullstackopen.com/osa3/node_js_ja_express) on course Full Stack Open (University of Helsinki).

My main repo for other weeks is [here](https://github.com/sallasal/FullStackOpen).

**Heroku remote backend: https://gentle-meadow-01806.herokuapp.com/**, json data https://gentle-meadow-01806.herokuapp.com/api/persons .

I needed to reorganize my repository (this is, create totally new) on exercise 3.10. Older commits are still [here](https://github.com/sallasal/FullStack-osa-3).
